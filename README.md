# question_1



FCFS and SJF have the same average waiting time and average turnaround time. These two algorithms perform equally well in terms of these metrics.
PS (Priority Scheduling) has a slightly higher average waiting time and average turnaround time compared to FCFS and SJF. This is because PS may not always prioritize the shortest job or the job with the earliest arrival time.
RR (Round Robin) has the highest average waiting time and average turnaround time among the four algorithms. This is because RR may cause some processes to wait longer due to its fixed time quantum, which doesn't necessarily prioritize short jobs or high-priority jobs.
Conclusion:

In this specific scenario, where the goal is to minimize the average waiting time and average turnaround time, both FCFS and SJF algorithms are equally suitable and perform better than PS and RR.
FCFS and SJF provide the most efficient scheduling in terms of these metrics.
